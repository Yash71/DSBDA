Calculating True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN) is useful for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model. These metrics are commonly used to calculate other performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

* True Positives (TP) represents the number of correct positive predictions, i.e., the number of instances that were correctly classified as positive by the model.
* True Negatives (TN) represents the number of correct negative predictions, i.e., the number of instances that were correctly classified as negative by the model.
* False Positives (FP) represents the number of incorrect positive predictions, i.e., the number of instances that were incorrectly classified as positive by the model.
* False Negatives (FN) represents the number of incorrect negative predictions, i.e., the number of instances that were incorrectly classified as negative by the model. <br>

By calculating these metrics, we can get a better understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses. For example, a high number of False Positives indicates that the model is incorrectly classifying negative instances as positive, which could lead to false alarms or unnecessary actions. On the other hand, a high number of False Negatives indicates that the model is incorrectly classifying positive instances as negative, which could lead to missed opportunities or failures to take action when necessary.
